  description: "#101Nights emanated from Dream Sessions. It confront the subjective dreams perception of the artist Nathalie Regard with an objective, quantitative analysis, through brain recordings, seeking to establish a bridge between these two dimensions. Here we will take all the data from the 101 nights recorded, convert them into BIDS format, and extract physiological markers. We will also analyze the text of all the dream reports and daily logs of Nathalie. Finally, we will try to build a neurophenomenological network reflecting the performance."

- title: "Spatio-temporal dynamics of brain network connectivity"
  author: Nicolas Farrugia
  short_description: "A set of functions on notebooks to perform dynamic connectivity analysis using python / sklearn / nilearn / bct."
  description: "The goal of this project is to opensource ongoing efforts to estimate various aspects of dynamic connectivity analysis. As a starting point, we will provide (1a) a set of functions that use sklearn, nilearn, bct (+numpy, scipy, nistats,...) that can be used to estimate dynamics states with various connectivity metrics, sliding windows and clustering algorithms (1b) as well as decomposition methods (ICA, dictionary learning), (2) simple methods to calculate null statistical models using bootstrapping procedures, (3) dynamic graph theory metrics, and (4) basic visualizations. We encourage researchers to join us in order to either help building the examples, or contribute with new methods, or test our methods on their own data."
