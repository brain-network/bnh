  description: "#101Nights emanated from Dream Sessions. It confront the subjective dreams perception of the artist Nathalie Regard with an objective, quantitative analysis, through brain recordings, seeking to establish a bridge between these two dimensions. Here we will take all the data from the 101 nights recorded, convert them into BIDS format, and extract physiological markers. We will also analyze the text of all the dream reports and daily logs of Nathalie. Finally, we will try to build a neurophenomenological network reflecting the performance."

- title: "Spatio-temporal dynamics of brain network connectivity"
  author: Nicolas Farrugia
  short_description: "A set of functions on notebooks to perform dynamic connectivity analysis using python / sklearn / nilearn / bct."
  description: "The goal of this project is to opensource ongoing efforts to estimate various aspects of dynamic connectivity analysis. As a starting point, we will provide (1a) a set of functions that use sklearn, nilearn, bct (+numpy, scipy, nistats,...) that can be used to estimate dynamics states with various connectivity metrics, sliding windows and clustering algorithms (1b) as well as decomposition methods (ICA, dictionary learning), (2) simple methods to calculate null statistical models using bootstrapping procedures, (3) dynamic graph theory metrics, and (4) basic visualizations. We encourage researchers to join us in order to either help building the examples, or contribute with new methods, or test our methods on their own data."

- title: "Functional connectivity fingerprinting: maximizing identifiability in human functional connectomes"
  author: Enrico Amico
  short_description: "We will cover recent data-driven methods to measure and/or improve the capacity of individual fingerprinting from functional connectivity data (Finn et al., Nature Neuroscience 2015, Amico and Goñi, Scientific Reports (in press) 2018)."
  description: "The concept of identifiability based on brain connectivity is very new (Finn et al. Nature Neuroscience 2015). Most recently, we made a significant step forward on this topic by introducing a data-driven method for optimal reconstruction of individual functional connectivity patterns that retrieves hidden identifiability from the data (Amico and Goñi, Scientific Reports (in press) 2018). In this Hackathon project we will cover the concept of fingerprinting on human brain data. In particular, we will provide sample functional connectivity data and guide you to the procedure for maximizing identifiability. Participants are welcome to bring and work on their own functional connectivity data. Resting-state or task-based data are welcome, as well as healthy or diseased population (fully processed; please note that fMRI processing is not a topic of this project :) ). If your dataset only has one fMRI run per subject, we can `create` test-retest sessions by splitting the run into first and second half and getting the FCs on each half.
