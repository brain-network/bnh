### Website

To build the website locally, you first need to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Then, you can launch in two terminal windows, from the repository folder, the following commands:

```sh
sass --watch docs/assets/sass/:docs/assets/css/
```

to build the `css` style sheets, and,

```sh
jekyll serve --source docs/
```

to start a Jekyll server.

You should now be able to access the website at the following address: http://127.0.0.1:4000.
